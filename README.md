# 📘 LeetCode Python Practice

This repository is a personal coding log and growth tracker by a Data Science student actively preparing for:
- **Placement interviews**
- **Summer internships**
- **Tech internships (2025 and beyond)**

Beyond career goals, this repo represents a journey of continuous improvement — aiming to become fluent in Python, improve logic and algorithmic thinking, and ultimately become confident enough to solve problems without external help.

## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

I'm not just solving problems — I'm tracking growth.

I want to:
- Think like a programmer
- Debug like a problem-solver
- Build confidence for freelancing and job interviews
- Inspire others to do the same by showing consistent daily effort

Follow my journey. I’m excited to see how far I can grow.
